The sole purpose of this app is to back up the current wallpaper.

Up to Android 13 you need to grant the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to access the wallpaper.

On Android 13 “Tiramisu” it is necessary to grant the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
This permission also allows read and write access to all user files on the device. The app does not use the permission to access any files though.

On Android 14 and higher it is necessary to grant the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission and the `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission.
