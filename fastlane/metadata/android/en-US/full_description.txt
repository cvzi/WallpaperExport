The sole purpose of this app is to back up the current wallpaper.

Up to Android 13 you need to grant the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to access the wallpaper.

On Android 13 “Tiramisu” it is necessary to grant the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
This permission also allows read and write access to all user files on the device. The app does not use the permission to access any files though.
